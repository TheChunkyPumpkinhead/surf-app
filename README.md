Pain Management Capstone
This is a troubleshooting application for people to seek out a solution for their pain. Users can view a guide on how to treat trigger points via massage therapy, and a simple guideline page on what a trigger point is. Users will be guided to a trigger point corresponding to their area of pain by selecting an image, they can save this trigger point to their account and add notes.
